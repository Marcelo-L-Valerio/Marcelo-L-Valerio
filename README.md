# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Welcome, my name is Marcelo Lopes Valerio.

- ðŸ”­ I'm a backend developer, using .Net Core and Django Rest Framework in my applications!
- ðŸŒ± Nowadays, I'm focusing a bit more in .Net, to increase my knowledge about APIs construction.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love tibia-styled games, but my experience with the real Tibia is almost none.

  ## About Me
  
  ### I'm a student at University of SÃ£o Paulo, currently studying Materials Engineering, and did my exchange program in Ã’buda University, Hungary, as a computer science student.
  ### My first contact with programming was in college, but I only became focused on the area in 2022, with the CÃ³digo[S] python bootcamp, offered by Stone in a partnership with how bootcamps, where I had my first contact with web development and, obviously, the backend, witch would become my passion from then on.
  ### With the CÃ³digo[S] iniciative, i had the opportunity to learn from basics in programming to a intermediate, at least i expect, in web and API development, and I was invited to the presential final, where they selected 16 students to visit Stone Co headquarters, and develop a product project in teams.
  ### During my exchange program in the first half of 2023, I improved both my soft and hard skills, with Cloud, Big Data, software architecture, among many others, in addition to, of course, English. Some of the subjects where Software Design and Development 2, where I earned more experience in C#, and it's particular arquiteture, with delegates, events, and interfaces; Cloud Computing Systems 2, where I learned the basics of Open Nebula, and dived more into Docker world; Database - and Big Data technologies, in which I learned the usage of NoSql databases, mainly MongoDB and Cassandra, and also Spark Apache, data lake and the basics into the Big Data Analytics world. Furthermore, had Recent Advances in Intelligent Technology, which was a group of lectures of reference names in the area, to talk about their projects in many areas, like medical, data manipulation, and others.
  ### As already said, my main technologies are C#, .Net Core, Python, Django, Django Rest Framework Docker, and SQL, but I also studied a bit about machine learning and Big Data. Nowadays looking for my first professional experience!
  
  ### Here are some of my main projects:
