# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Welcome, my name is Marcelo Lopes Valerio.

- ðŸ”­ I'm a backend developer, using Django Rest Framework in my applications!
- ðŸŒ± Nowadays, I'm increasing my habilities with DRF, but recently started my JavaScript studies.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love tibia-styled games, but my experience with the real Tibia is almost none.

  ## About Me
  
  ### I'm a student at University of SÃ£o Paulo, currently studying Materials Engineering, and in a few days, also a student of Ã’buda University, Hungary, where i'll course one semester of computer science as an exchange student.
  ### My first contact with programming was in college, but I only became focused on the area in 2022, with the CÃ³digo[S] python bootcamp, offered by Stone in a partnership with how bootcamps, where I had my first contact with web development and, obviously, the backend, witch would become my passion from then on.
  ### With the CÃ³digo[S] iniciative, i had the opportunity to learn from basics in programming to a intermediate, at least i expect, in web and API development, and I was invited to the presential final, where they selected 16 students to visit Stone Co headquarters, and develop a product project in teams.
  ### As already said, my main technologies are Python, Django, Django Rest Framework and MySQL, but I also studied a bit about machine learning and Big Data. My next steps are, besides inproving my DRF habilities, learn JavaScript, and a little of PhP, the last one at the Ã’buda University. I'm also studing some development fundamentals, like docker, AWS, JWT authentication, but only the pretty basics.
  
  ### Here are some of my main projects:
